			<h1 class="uppercase">Jason Alexander Returns to the Stage</h1>
			<br>
			<p class="author">By Michael Schulman</p>
			<p>An actor’s life is full of chance. Jason Alexander was twenty when he got what he thought was his big break, a role in Stephen Sondheim and George Furth’s new Broadway musical “Merrily We Roll Along,” directed by Hal Prince. Born Jason Greenspan, Alexander was already a veteran of Hershey’s Kisses commercials and New Jersey theatre, but now he was working with Broadway royalty. As it turned out, “Merrily” was a mess: the story was muddled (though the score remains beloved), audiences left in droves, and the show closed in twelve days. “I still hold it true that it was the greatest learning experience that I could have had,” Alexander said recently, “because I was watching people with consummate ability struggle. It taught me very early that even the gods are human.”</p>

			<p>Nonetheless, Alexander had a busy stage career in the years before George Costanza. In 1984, he starred alongside Liza Minnelli and Chita Rivera in the Kander and Ebb musical “The Rink”—another flop. “It’s the only time I’ve been completely blindsided by opening-night reviews,” Alexander said. He rebounded in Neil Simon’s “Broadway Bound,” then shot a sitcom called “Everything’s Relative,” which lasted only six episodes. When he was offered an audition for “Jerome Robbins’ Broadway,” a revue of the choreographer’s greatest hits, he turned it down three times: “I’m an actor who dances, but I’m not a dancer. I thought, What the hell am I going to do?” He was cast anyway, which meant working with the mercurial Robbins, who was directing his own self-tribute. “Everything that made Jerry Robbins a challenging human being was on display during our five months of rehearsal and tech,” Alexander recalled. But—surprise!—the show was a hit. Alexander won a Tony Award, the exposure led to “Pretty Woman” and “Seinfeld,” and, yada, yada, yada, the residual checks are still rolling in.</p>

			<p>Alexander is now back onstage in “The Portuguese Kid,” a comedy written and directed by John Patrick Shanley, the author of “Doubt.” (The Manhattan Theatre Club production opens Oct. 24, at City Center Stage I.) Alexander plays a lawyer in Providence, Rhode Island, dealing with an overbearing mother (Mary Testa), a sexy Greek widow with a past (Sherie Rene Scott), and his own high anxiety. A starry cast, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright: Alexander knows from experience not to rest on pedigree. “It’s the same as the first time you get up,” he said. “You cross your fingers, and you pray to the gods that it will work.”</p>
